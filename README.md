XFileMesh
  I Think Microsoft's XFile is just a legacy format for most developers, completely obsoleted, but when I tried to render it in directx11, I couldn't find the way to render it with modern DirectX, so I wrote the code from scratch to read the "x file" and render them. I think this is useless for most developers, but if you need it, this might help you. This project was built with "Visual Studio 2012" and "Windows Kit 8.0".
