# XFileMesh
Microsoft's XFile is just a legacy for almost developers, historical one, but when I tried to render it in directx11, I couldn't find the way to render it with modern directx, so I wrote the full-scratched code to read the file and render it. I think this is useless for most developers, but if you need it, this might help you. this built with visual studio 2012.
