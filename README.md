# XFileMesh
Microsoft's XFile is just a legacy for most developers, historical one, but when I tried to render it in directx11, I couldn't find the way to render it with modern DirectX, so I wrote the full-scratched code to read the file and render them. I think this is useless for most developers, but if you need it, this might help you. This project was built with "Visual Studio 2012" and "Windows Kit 8.0".
